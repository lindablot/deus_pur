# deus_pur
This library has been developed to perform statistical analyses of power spectra measured from large set of simulations.
In particular it is possible to compute:
- mean
- standard deviation
- skewness
- kurtosis
- covariance
- correlation coefficient
- signal-to-noise
- Fisher matrix for cosmological parameters using emulators to compute derivatives
- variance of the covariance
- variance of the inverse covariance
- bias of the inverse covariance

It currently supports the matter power spectrum of the DEUS PUR set of simulations (master branch) and the halo power spectrum in real and redshift space from the sets of approximate methods used for the Euclid covariance comparison project (euclid branch).
